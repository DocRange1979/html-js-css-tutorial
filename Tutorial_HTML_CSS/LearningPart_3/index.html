            <h1> Hyperlinks, file naming and anchors</h1>
            <p> 
                The main file <strong>must be called index</strong> but every other fie can be named
                whatever you want
            </p>

            <p> 
                An example of a link can be like <strong><a href="https://google.com">Google</a></strong> and as you can see
                I can edit it with strong or italic tags too! But if it is not in my folder of files then I have to add the 
                <em>https:</em> or the <em>http:</em> for the external URs
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I will do a link for a page that I have in my folder so the link is right <a href="anchor.html">here</a>
            </p>
